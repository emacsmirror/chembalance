* chembalance.el

Balance chemical equations.

** Installation:
   
After installing the package (or copying it to your load-path), add this
to your init file:

~(require 'chembalance)~


** Usage:
   
It works interactively (entering your equation at the minibuffer) and
also with region.

~M-x chembalance~ => goes to the minibuffer. Enter equation.

Ex.  FeS + O2 => Fe2O3 + SO2

It returns:

~Balanced reaction : 4 FeS + 7 O2 => 2 Fe2O3 + 4 SO2~

You can also use it to check if a reaction is already balanced.

You can mark a region with a chemical equation and then ~M-x chembalance~.

It will give you the balanced equation.

Chembalance supports formulas with parentheses.

Ex: 3 Hg(OH)2 + 2 H3PO4 => Hg3(PO4)2 + 6 H2O


** Customize:

To customize chembalance, do ~M-x customize-group RET chembalance~.

There are two custom variables:

~chembalance-arrow-syntax~ (list of accepted arrows).

~chembalance-insert-string~ (if non-nil, when you call chembalance with selected
region, chembalance will kill that region and insert the balanced
reaction).

** Known issues:

   If there is an error in the calculation process, you will see a
   buffer with the error and the calc buffer opened (--- Emacs
   Calculator Mode ---).
